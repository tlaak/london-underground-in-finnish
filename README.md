# London Underground Stations in Finnish

This is my small little hobby project to translate all London underground station names to Finnish.

It's very much work in progress and help is appreciated.

If you'd like to contribute, please keep your suggestions on a professional level and avoid humorous translations (I'm looking at you, Liverpool Street). Translations should be based on the historical context and follow the Finnish naming conventions wherever possible.

For the names which just don't translate easily (Theydon Bois, anyone?), creativity might be needed.
