## Summary

| London Underground station | Finnish translation |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Acton Town                 | Tammela             |
| East Acton                 | Itä-Tammela         |
| West Acton                 | Länsi-Tammela       |

## Background

[Acton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acton,_London) is located in the borough of Ealing in West London.

There are four London Underground stations in Acton serving Central, District and Piccadilly Lines. The stations are Acton Town, East Acton, West Acton and North Acton.

According to Wikipedia:

> Acton means "oak farm" or "farm by oak trees", and is derived from the Old English _āc_ (oak) and _tūn_ (farm)

## Direct translations

| English | Finnish                   |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| oak     | tammi                     |
| farm    | maatila, tila             |
| town    | kunta, kaupunki, kauppala |
| east    | itä                       |
| west    | länsi                     |
| north   | pohjoinen, pohjois-       |

Direct translation of Acton using the English meaning would be _Tammimaatila_ or _Tammitila_. While the first one sounds very strange, the second one feels a bit more natural and exists in Finnish place names. It's still not perfect though.

## Conclusion

House or place names and surnames in Finland often have a _-la_ / _-lä-_ suffix in the west and _-nen_ in the east. A farm by the oak trees would most likely be called simply _Tammela_.

Including the word _town_ in the translation feels like an unnecessary addition so I have chosen to drop it out. I don't think the suffixes _-la_ or _-lä_ ever appear with the word _-kaupunki_ at the same time in Finnish place names.

There is a [municipality of Tammela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammela,_Finland) in southwestern Finland and Tammela is also a district in the city of Tampere. That's why I have chosen the Finnish equivalent of Acton to be _Tammela_.
