## Background

Chancery Lane station takes its name from the nearby [Chancery Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancery_Lane). It's located in the ward of Farringdon Without in the City of London, and the lane itself is named after the [High Court of Chancery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Chancery).

## Direct translations

| English  | Finnish             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| chancery | kanslerinoikeus     |
| lane     | kuja, kaista, väylä |

Court of Chancery in Finnish translates as _Kanslerinoikeus_ after the Swedish _Kanslersrätten_, although there seems to be no equivalent in the Finnish jurisdiction.

Lane can mean either a _kuja_ (also an alley), _kaista_ (a single lane of a road) or _väylä_, which is more of a passage, sometimes translated as _pasaasi_ in Finnish. In this context _kuja_ seems to be the best option to use.

## Conclusion

_Kanslerioikeudenkuja_ sounds like a name of a historical street that could actually exist in Finland. There are several streets that got their names after courts of jurisdiction, e.g. Hovioikeudenpuistikko in Vaasa and Raastuvankatu in Vaasa and Turku.

Therefore _Kanslerioikeudenkuja_ sounds like the perfect translation of Chancery Lane.
