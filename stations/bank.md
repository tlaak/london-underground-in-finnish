# Bank

Bank station is served by Central, Northern and Waterloo & City lines, and the DLR.

## Summary

| London Underground station | Finnish translation |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Bank                       | Pankki              |

## Background

Bank is located in the Bank junction and is named after Bank of England, which means it's simple and easy to translate.

## Direct translations

| English | Finnish |
| ------- | ------- |
| bank    | pankki  |

The direct translation of _bank_ is simply _pankki_ in the original context. Bank could also mean a river bank (penkka in Finnish) but this is not the etymology of the station name.

## Conclusion

I'm not aware of any places called _Pankki_ in Finland, other than a restaurant in Eura. I'd still use the direct translation as there are no better alternatives. Therefore Bank station in Finnish shall be called _Pankki_.
