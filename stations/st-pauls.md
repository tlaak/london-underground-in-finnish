## Conclusion

There is a [tram stop](https://reittiopas.hsl.fi/pysakit/HSL:1220403) called _Paavalinkirkko_ (_Paul's Church_) in Helsinki, next to a [church](https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/artikkelit/paavalinkirkko_1) bearing the same name. The church is not quite as famous or big as St. Paul's Cathedral in London, but the name suits the needs of this project perfectly.
