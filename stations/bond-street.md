## Background

Bond Street is [named after baronet Sir Thomas Bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_Street) who developed the area in the 17th century. Sir Thomas Bond is also a supposed ancestor of James Bond, the fictional MI6 agent 007.

## Direct translations

| English | Finnish                   |

| bond    | maanviljelijä, talonpoika |
| street  | katu                      |

The word _street_ translates simply as _katu_.

The word _bond_ has many different meanings in different contexts but [as a last name it means a husbandman](https://www.houseofnames.com/bond-family-crest), i.e. _a farmer_. The direct translation of the words _Bond Street_ is simply either _Maanviljelijänkatu_ or _Talonpojankatu_. The old Finnish word for a farmer is _talonpoika_ after the Swedish word _bonde_, which seems to have the same roots as the English _bond_. _Talonpoika_ sounds more historical and more suitable for a street name. _Talonpojankatu_ is also an existing street name in Finland (e.g. in Kokkola and Laukaa), thus I've chosen it as the translation for Bond Street.

## Conclusion

Direct translation makes sense, so Bond Street will be called _Talonpojankatu_.
